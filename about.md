Hey!

Thanks for taking taking the time to check out my photography blog. 
Some of you may know me by my real name, Aaron, my Instagram name aaucci, or my photography name **flmcci**.

My photography journey started back in 2021, when I inherited my Mom's old Pentax film camera. From there, it was all about a journey of fun and learning.

Between 2021 and now, I've used two Ricoh KR-5's, a Canon Sureshot Zoom 85, and now, a Fujifilm X-T3! Although, I may not shoot film on a consistent basis, I felt too attached to my photography name to give it up.

Until now, I have been uploading a few of my shots on my Instagram, but I realized I was sort of dismissing that _thought behind the shot_, and figured I might as well make a blog and be more intimate regarding my photos and the experiences behind not just those shots but the experience behind them.

So, that leads us here! I'm extremely excited to share ALL (if _all_ can be retrieved) of my photos on here, and I can't wait to see where the future takes me!
